#CalculusProject

This is the code from my AP Calculus BC project I completed at the end of my senior year. My portion of the project
was to figure out the algorithm the TI-84 uses to solve definite integrals. 

Had I written the code now I would have definitely done some stuff differently. For starters, I would have used Python
because its eval() functions allows for the easy conversion of mathematical expressions to something which can be 
operated on. Had I still really wanted to use java however, I would have used parse tree algorithm rather than the more
cumbersome postfix and stack evaluation algorithm, which requires the shunting-yard algorithm to convert the original 
expression from infix to postfix notation.
